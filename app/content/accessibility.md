title: Accessibility statement for Claim funding for mentor training
---

This service is run by the Becoming a Teacher team at the Department for Education. We want as many people as possible to be able to use the service. For example, that means users should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings
- zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using a keyboard or speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We also used a professional content designer to make the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.
